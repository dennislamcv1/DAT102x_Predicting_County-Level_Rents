# DAT102x_Predicting_County-Level_Rents

About the Data

Your goal is to predict the median gross rent at the county level from other socioeconomic and demographic indicators.

### Features

There are 43 variables in this dataset. Each row in the dataset represents a United States county in a single year. We provide a unique identifier for an individual county, but note that the counties in the test set are distinct from counties in the train set. In other words, no county that appears in the train set will appear in the test set. Thus, county-specific features (i.e. county dummy variables) will not be an option. However, the counties in the test set still share similar patterns as those in the train set and so other feature engineering will work the same as usual.

Each county in the U.S. is assigned one of the 9 codes." (USDA Economic Research Service)
